During the Highlands trip, I have kept my ears on some interesting sounds. In Scotland everything is around water so everywhere you turn on your mic you get some hissing sounds of the landscape liquid flows. I struggle to escape this pattern of nature recordings. Here I present an interesting phenomena where a branch of [_Salix caprea_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_caprea) got captured between another branch of the same tree. When strong winds occoured an interesting phenomena could be captured.
