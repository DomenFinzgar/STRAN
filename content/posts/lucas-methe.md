[Lucas Methe ](https://www.instagram.com/lucas.methe/)will finally get his first book chapter in English. I have been working with [Johanne Deffarges](https://johannedeffarges.com/) for months now to present this amazing French author to international audiences. Soon you will find his comic "Mommy in love with all the children" in the autumn 2020 [Stripburger](www.stripburger.org) issue.
