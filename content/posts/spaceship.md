**Å pik** is a mountain in the [Slovenian Julian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Alps). Its summit is at 2,472 m (8110 feet) above sea level. The mountain's name is a cognate of the English "spike," derived from its pointed shape. Together with surrounding mountains called as the "Martuljek Group", it can't be missed when one passes by on a buisy road towards Kranjska Gora. dramatic topography is feeding imagination to every curious mind that wants to elevate.
