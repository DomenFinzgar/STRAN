**Å pik** is a mountain in the [Slovenian Julian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Alps). Its summit is at 2,472 m (8110 feet) above sea level. The mountain's name is a cognate of the English "spike," derived from its pointed shape. Together with surrounding mountains known as the "[Martuljek Group](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martulj%C5%A1ka_skupina#/media/Slika:MartuljskaSkupina-Imena1.jpg)", it can't be missed when one passes by on a busy road towards Kranjska Gora. Dramatic topography is feeding imagination of every curious mind that wants to elevate.

The topography was used as a spaceship body, re-interpretation of the famous [MicroProse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse) space scene on the moon.
