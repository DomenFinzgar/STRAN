+++

Church of the Holy Spirit ([Saint-Esprit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Esprit,_Paris)) in Paris was mostly empty. Not only is praying in Paris allowed only through masks, but the church's roof was also occupied by men at work, trying to bring the old sparkle to this shrine. A beautiful reinterpretation of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul has some of the most astounding frescoes made by the contemporary artists from [Ateliers d'Art Sacr√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateliers_d%27Art_Sacr%C3%A9) movement. Great acoustic, historical lack of tourists, declining numbers of practising believers and COVID strangeness - this recording captures it all.
