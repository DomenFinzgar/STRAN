Salonski has migrated to SLN and is currently residing somewhere in the vast space between Scotland and Slovenia. The transcendental journey of a cosmonaut SLN reincarnated in a new, short, three compositions (Necromancy, Telepathy and Reincarnation) coming out on 5th of November. To commemorate the lift-off, I have decided to bring you a limited edition of personalized recordings for the song Reincarnation.

A 25$ cut vinyl will contain a personalized version of the song, recorded especially for you. No other copies made! Individual live performance directly from my apartment back to you. Audio vinyl postcard made from scratch. Only 14 days for you to preorder it! HERE:

(all orders get a digital version too, just in case, plus the whole album of course!)

Reincarnation is a concerto for clarinet and a small orchestra with field recordings, so you are in for a treat. I know 25$ is A-LOT for most of us, so 50% profits will be donated to the free-for-all scientific journal site*. This way, you are supporting free knowledge for everyone. Good cause and art!

You can alternatively support the release by buying the online, generic (yea, not that exciting anymore is it!) release on Bandcamp for 10EUR.

Let’s make this a successful lift-off! Share! See you soon!
