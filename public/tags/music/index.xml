      <description>Captains room. 04:38 AM: Using glossolalia to contact CS in Canada. Lots of interference from the Japanese. Target reached. Could not remove the noises. The conversation lasted for over 7 min. That is something. Cloudy weather outside, light rain, strong winds. Cabin barely isolated. One can hear birds singing even at the North sea. Must be that time of year. Plenty of Raum and plenty of Zeit.

      <description>“Paris in the fall, the last months of the year, at the end of the millennium. The city holds many memories for me, of cafes, of music, of love, and of death.”
After this rather famous quote, the music of the late Barrington Pheloung starts looming over the Notre-Dame gargoyle. I was just turning seven when I heard it for the first time, and since then the melody stuck with me and set my view on film composition.</description>
